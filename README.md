# Instructions
- Download TPP.html
- Open it using any text editor (notepad, notepad++, Atom, etc..)
- Locate the oauth token and your twitch username at the top
- Change Baasbase into your twitch username, make sure to put it between the single quotes.
- Change the oauth token to the token generated at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/ (you will need to login using the twitch account with which you will be streaming this)
- Save the html file
- Create a new browser source in OBS
- Source is a local file -> the html file you just downloaded and edited
- Width: 640
- Height: 1152

And that's it! You are now free to resize the panel, and use alt+resize to remove the bottom part if you don't want the chat messages to appear on screen

# Audio
By default, a browser page needs any sort of input from the user to be able to play audio.  
So, if you want to enable audio for the gameboy, you should follow a few extra steps:
- Edit *TPP.html*
  - Change *var useAudio = false;* to *var useAudio = true;*  
- Reload the browser source in OBS, you will now see a button which reads "Start ROM". 
- Right click the browser source > Interact.
- OBS will open a new window which is interactable.
- Click the button, it will load the gameboy with sound enabled
- You can close the interactable OBS window
- If you want to adjust the volume of the gameboy (it starts very loud)
  - Go to your browser source properties
  - Enable *Control audio via OBS*
  - Now you will have a volume slider, but you won't hear the audio
  - Right click the volume slider and go to *Advanced Audio Properties*
  - Find your browser source and set Audio Monitoring to *Monitor and Output*
  - Now you can freely adjust the volume of the gameboy!

# Saving and loading
**!save** to save the current state of the gameboy.  
**!delete** to delete the save state. *Warning: This does not ask for confirmation and can not be undone*.

If you load the scene or refresh the browser source it will automatically load the last saved sate.  
*Warning: Switching scenes or hiding the browser source will NOT automatically save the state. Use !save first to prevent losing progress*

# Credits
Using this is free. However, it would be greatly appreciated if you could credit https://twitch.tv/baasbase somewhere in a twitch panel or on a label on screen. That way you will support me in making more awesome stuff like this ‚ù§
